# 15Puzzle

The implementation of the non-recursive method for solving the 15 puzzle using a deque was successful. I found a linkedList to be the best
option for implementation, as it was really simple to add and remove objects to and from it. I did use two linked lists, one to track and 
store the moves and one to make the moves. These two linked lists run parallel, where every time one is changed, so it the other.
